   <h1>What is HomoMilk</h1>
   <hr>

   <p>
    
    Homogenized or homo milk (meaning shaken up so the fat solids combine with the liquid), includes calcium, protein, potassium and vitamins A, B12, D, E and K. Because homo milk contains 3.25% milk fat, it’s more nutrient-dense (nutrients come from healthy fats). Plus, it’s ideal for frothing and adding to your latte or cappuccino. 

    For a lighter taste, 1% or 2% milk are options that are also a source of these essential nutrients..</p>
